# Notes

These notes are from [Google Generative AI Learning Path (Gen AI)](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/journeys/118)

The 9 courses covered in this pathway are as follows:

## 1. Introduction to Generative AI
This is an introductory level microlearning course aimed at explaining what Generative AI is, how it is used, and how it differs from traditional machine learning methods. It also covers Google Tools to help you develop your own Gen AI application. 

## 2. Introduction to Large Language Models
 This is an introductory level microlearning course that explores what large language models (LLM) are, the use cases where they can be utilized, and how you can use prompt tuning to enhance LLM performance. It also covers Google tools to utilize Large Language Models. 

## 3. Introduction to Responsible AI
This is an introductory-level microlearning course aimed at explaining what responsible AI is, why it's important, and how Google implements responsible AI in their products. It also introduces Google's 7 AI principles.

## 4. Generative AI Fundamentals
Earn a skill badge by completing the Introduction to Generative AI, Introduction to Large Language Models and Introduction to Responsible AI courses. By passing the final quiz, you'll demonstrate your understanding of foundational concepts in generative AI.

## 5. Introduction to Image Generation
This course introduces diffusion models, a family of machine learning models that recently showed promise in the image generation space. Diffusion models draw inspiration from physics, specifically thermodynamics. Within the last few years, diffusion models became popular in both research and application development. 

## 6. Encoder-Decoder Architecture
This course gives you a synopsis of the encoder-decoder architecture, which is a powerful and prevalent machine learning architecture for sequence-to-sequence tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and question answering. You learn about the main components of the encoder-decoder architecture. 

## 7. Attention Mechanism
This course will introduce you to the attention mechanism, a powerful technique that allows neural networks to focus on specific parts of an input sequence. You will learn how attention works, and how it can be used to improve the results from the Neural Networks. 

## 8. Transformer Models and BERT Model
This course introduces you to the Transformer architecture and the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model. You learn about the main components of the Transformer architecture, such as the self-attention mechanism, and how it is used to build the BERT Models. 

## 9. Create Image Captioning Models
This course teaches you how to create an image captioning model by using deep learning. You learn about the different components of an image captioning model, such as the encoder and decoder, and how to train and evaluate your model.

## 10. Introduction to Generative AI Studio
This course introduces Generative AI Studio, a product on Vertex AI, that helps you prototype and customize generative AI models so you can use their capabilities in your applications. In this course, you learn what Generative AI Studio is, its usage with generative models.
