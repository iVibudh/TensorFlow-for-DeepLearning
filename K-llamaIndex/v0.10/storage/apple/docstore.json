The\nCompany\u2019 s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and\napplications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\u2019 s product features and applications within their products, or\ncollaborate to of fer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently of fer.\nSupply of Components\nAlthough most components essential to the Com pany\u2019 s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from\nsingle or limited sources . The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers,\ntablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company , including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times\nsubject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitor s, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize\ncustom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the\nsuppliers\u2019  yields have matured or their manufact uring capacities have increased. The continued  availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all,\nmay be affected if suppliers decide to concent rate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019 s\nrequirements.\nThe Company has enter ed into agreements for the supply of many components; however , there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or\nrenew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019 s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partner s that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers\nmanufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.\nResearch and Development\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technolog ical advances, the Company\u2019 s ability to compete successfully\ndepends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company\ncontinues to develop new technologies to enhan ce existing products and services, and to expan d the range of its offerings through research and development\n(\u201cR&D\u201d), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology .\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certa in aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and\nservices. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although\nthe Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in\npart on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\nThe Compa ny regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and\nmarketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and\nregistered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company\u2019 s products and\nservices. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property , many of the Company\u2019 s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third\nparties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company\u2019 s products, processes and services. While the\nCompany has generally  been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be\nobtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 3", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5222, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "18b3e522-e613-426e-bcc5-35c70973d120": {"__data__": {"id_": "18b3e522-e613-426e-bcc5-35c70973d120", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\vibud\\Desktop\\Github\\TensorFlow-for-DeepLearning\\K-llamaIndex\\v0.10\\data\\apple\\apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 840980, "creation_date": "2024-03-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e190dae7-5e36-42cb-b28b-060c523a5a87", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\vibud\\Desktop\\Github\\TensorFlow-for-DeepLearning\\K-llamaIndex\\v0.10\\data\\apple\\apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 840980, "creation_date": "2024-03-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-28"}, "hash": "7fb1ecc174dd68cabda8a7543abd1a9cb33717a715c239ff04c5a3a7f1b4333d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1913201a-4ed4-4d4e-badd-004a9f51d8e8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\vibud\\Desktop\\Github\\TensorFlow-for-DeepLearning\\K-llamaIndex\\v0.10\\data\\apple\\apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 840980, "creation_date": "2024-03-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-28"}, "hash": "ae9732c4624b6e781e85cbd9036a0a829c1612300b166e2fd78485fc0785c70a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "168279f2-785e-4c4a-86ae-8222b0abdc59", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cb7f67edaca8ad13c1ee2057766b01b6d45888a459e678a8f105bbb0d5e21d2f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Business Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday\ndemand. Additionally , new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales , cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product\nintroductions can also impact the Company\u2019 s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product\nlaunch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer produ ct approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers\nand distributors anticipate a product introduction.\nHuman Capital\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motiva ted and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team\nmembers. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had approximately 164,000 full-time equivalent employees.\nWorkplace Practices and Policies\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination.\nCompensation and Benefits\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company\u2019 s success. The\nCompany recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their\nprofessional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and\nresources that are designed to support employees\u2019  individual growth and development.\nInclusion and Diversity\nThe Company remains committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company\ncontinues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture , and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all\nemployees.\nEngagement\nThe Company believes that open and honest  communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work\nenvironment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or\nconcerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity .\nHealth and Safety\nThe Compa ny is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop\nmeasures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety , security and crisis management training, and by putting specific\nprograms in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally , the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team\nmembers, visitors and customers through its global security team.

Risk Factors\nThe Compan y\u2019s busines s, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known\nor unknown,  including those described below . When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company\u2019 s business, reputation, results of\noperations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely af fected.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\u2019 s results of opera tions and financial condition, past financial performance should\nnot be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nThis discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019 s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\nThe Compa ny\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can\nmaterially adversely af fect the Company\u2019 s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Compa ny has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\u2019 s total net sales. In addition, the Company\u2019 s\nglobal suppl y chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company\u2019 s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the\nU.S. As a result, the Company\u2019 s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.\nAdverse macroeconomic  conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade, changes to fiscal and\nmonetary policy , tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuation s can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and\nmaterially adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019 s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely\naffected in response to financial market volatili ty, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset\nvalues, energy shortages and cost increases, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors.\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company\u2019 s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can have a\nsignificant impact on the Company\u2019 s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\nPotential ef fects include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company\u2019 s products; and insolvency .\nA downturn in the economic environment can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company\u2019 s trade receivables; the failure of derivative\ncounterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company\u2019 s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the\nCompany\u2019 s financial instruments. These and other economic factors can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019 s business, results of operations, financial\ncondition and stock price.\nThe Company\u2019 s business, results of operat ions, financial condition and stock price have been adversely affected and could in the future be\nmaterially adversely af fected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCOVID-19 has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in\nresponse. Such measures have included restrict ions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place\norders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial\nmarkets.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely  affected and could in the future materially adversely impact the\nCompany\u2019 s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. During the course of the pandemic, certain of the Company\u2019 s component\nsuppliers and manufactu ring and logistical service providers have experienced disruptions, resulting in supply shortages that affected sales worldwide, and\nsimilar disruptions could occur in the future.

Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse effects on demand\nfor the Company\u2019 s produ cts and services, the Company\u2019 s supply chain and sales and distributio n channels, the Company\u2019 s ability to execute its strategic plans,\nand the Company\u2019 s profitability and cost structure.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company\u2019 s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the\neffect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A  of this Form 10-K.\nThe Company\u2019 s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other internation al disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health\nissues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\nPolitical events, trade and other international  disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business\ninterruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy , and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers,\nsuppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\u2019 s total net sales, and the Company believes that it\ngenerally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company\u2019 s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners\nlocated primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts\ncan result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019 s business, particularly if\nthese measu res occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. For example,\ntensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business\nrestrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company\u2019 s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can\nadversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company\u2019 s products more expensive for customers, which\ncould make the Company\u2019 s products less compe titive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or\nexports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company\u2019 s operations and supply chain and limit the Company\u2019 s ability to offer its products\nand services as designe d. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships,\nand ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company\u2019 s operation s in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be\nexpensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company\u2019 s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company\nmay not be able to effectively mitigate all advers e impacts from such measures.

Certain competitors have\nthe resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have\nfrom time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\nAdditionally , the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\u2019 s product features and applications within their products or\ncollaborate to offer solutions that are more comp etitive than those they currently offer.

The success of new product and service introductions\ndepends on a number of factors, including timel y and successful development, market acceptance, the Company\u2019 s ability to manage the risks associated with\nproduction ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company\u2019 s produc ts, the effective management of purchase commitments and\ninventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriat e quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand,\nand the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage\nfuture introductions and transitions of products and services.\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical servic es provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are\nlocated outside of the U.S.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019 s manufacturin g is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland,\nIndia, Japan, South Kore a, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufac turing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing\npartners, often in single locations. Changes or additions to the Company\u2019 s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and\nuncertainties. The Company has also outsource d much of its transportation and logistics mana gement.

Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains\nresponsible to the consu mer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from\ntime to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time\nand can materially adversely af fect the Company\u2019 s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing\npartners primarily locate d in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company\u2019 s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a\nnegative impact on the Company\u2019 s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition , manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final\ndestinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes,\narmed conflict, economic, business, labor , environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.\nThe Company has inves ted in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to\ncertain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if\nthese outsou rcing partne rs or suppliers experien ce severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or\nterminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company\u2019 s ability to obtain components in suf ficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks.

If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company\u2019 s products, customers may choose not to buy\nthe Company\u2019 s products.\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers\u2019  perception and\nanalysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company\u2019 s products compared to competitors\u2019\nplatforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms.\nThis analysis  may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected\nfuture growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\nThe Company\u2019 s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade\nsoftware for the Company\u2019 s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors\u2019  products with larger\nmarket share.

The Company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company\u2019 s\nbusiness practices, and may in the future result in further changes. These changes could include how and to what extent the Company charges developers for\naccess to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company\nearns on those sales, would decrease.

Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and\ncompetition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company\u2019 s key personnel are located.

In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict.\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many companies across various\nindustries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns,\nmanages, stores and processes.\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of\nsensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauth orized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies,\nthese security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hack ing, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system\nerror, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company\u2019 s or its vendors\u2019  employees or\ncustomers into disclosing user names, passwor ds or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company\u2019 s or its\nvendors\u2019  systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company , the Compan y deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor\nauthentication, monitors its services and system s for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can\nresult in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company\u2019 s products and services.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverag e that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insuf ficient\nto cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company\u2019 s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated\nand materially adversely af fect the Company\u2019 s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions.

Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory\napprovals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise\nlimit the Com pany\u2019 s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction.

Other factors include the\nCompany\u2019 s ability to: manage costs associated  with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs\nassociated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 12", "start_char_idx": 4237, "end_char_idx": 5960, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cf09663b-8204-48c7-98ac-282b3c12461f": {"__data__": {"id_": "cf09663b-8204-48c7-98ac-282b3c12461f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\vibud\\Desktop\\Github\\TensorFlow-for-DeepLearning\\K-llamaIndex\\v0.10\\data\\apple\\apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 840980, "creation_date": "2024-03-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cdf61843-0ac2-490d-a0d4-834517c90138", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\vibud\\Desktop\\Github\\TensorFlow-for-DeepLearning\\K-llamaIndex\\v0.10\\data\\apple\\apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 840980, "creation_date": "2024-03-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-28"}, "hash": "bf908740e5d2947015ed6f1b184c88a43317197121d09ea4581787dd19062f10", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "32801bbc-fdde-4059-8b56-c0a4802584e1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\vibud\\Desktop\\Github\\TensorFlow-for-DeepLearning\\K-llamaIndex\\v0.10\\data\\apple\\apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 840980, "creation_date": "2024-03-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-28"}, "hash": "2792ef0a02513c883d68b8946d3fb5a8660dc4f8b13499c19ead5266b86e535d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "476e5cdb-7d25-4d8b-8c42-79a8f7c90be0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c329d333bb447275f9233ff31d0cfb32edd68281502dd86028f1740226349f9e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Legal and Regulatory Compliance Risks\nThe Company\u2019 s business, results of operatio ns and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or\ngovernment investigations.\nThe Company is subject  to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet\nbeen fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions\nwhich can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indem nified third party . The number of claims, legal proceedings and\ngovernment investigatio ns involving the Company , and the alleged magnitude of such claim s, proceedings and government investigations, has generally\nincreased over time and may continue to increase.\nThe Company has faced  and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the\nfuture. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on\nallegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company  is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several\nU.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintif fs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and\ndisruptive to the Compan y\u2019s operations. In recog nition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation\nand resolve  such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtaine d on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur . These\nagreements can also significantly increase the Company\u2019 s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and\nlimit the Company\u2019 s ability to of fer certain products and services.\nExcept as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d under the heading \u201cContingencies,\u201d in the opinion of management, there was\nnot at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss\ncontingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\nThe outcome of litigation  or government investiga tions is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified\nthird party in a reporting period for amounts above management\u2019 s expectations, the Company\u2019 s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting\nperiod could be materi ally adversely affected. Further , such an outcome can result in significant compensatory , punitive or trebled monetary damages,\ndisgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company , and can require the Company to change its business\npractices and limit the Company\u2019 s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could  materially adversely affect the Company\u2019 s business, reputation,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insuf ficient to cover all losses or all types of\nclaims that may arise.\nThe Compa ny is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased\ncosts and other adverse ef fects on the Company\u2019 s business.\nThe Company\u2019 s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy , data security and data\nlocalization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership\nand infringement; digital platforms; internet, telec ommunications, and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party\nsoftware applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions;\nanti\u2013money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety , including electronic waste, recycling, and climate change.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 13", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4807, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "476e5cdb-7d25-4d8b-8c42-79a8f7c90be0": {"__data__": {"id_": "476e5cdb-7d25-4d8b-8c42-79a8f7c90be0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\vibud\\Desktop\\Github\\TensorFlow-for-DeepLearning\\K-llamaIndex\\v0.10\\data\\apple\\apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 840980, "creation_date": "2024-03-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "07e2755d-a8b0-4479-9758-001881e26f86", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\vibud\\Desktop\\Github\\TensorFlow-for-DeepLearning\\K-llamaIndex\\v0.10\\data\\apple\\apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 840980, "creation_date": "2024-03-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-28"}, "hash": "cf90f7e5de1cd21516785b36557cfbed4d4b5d4030e49d5d3e0a24874c3a6322", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cf09663b-8204-48c7-98ac-282b3c12461f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\vibud\\Desktop\\Github\\TensorFlow-for-DeepLearning\\K-llamaIndex\\v0.10\\data\\apple\\apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 840980, "creation_date": "2024-03-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-28"}, "hash": "bf908740e5d2947015ed6f1b184c88a43317197121d09ea4581787dd19062f10", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ed36ba8d-b7b0-43fa-abb4-0fc606717862", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6e43f77b96ff86f787dc4af3df7d03cf88548e1566a36d5262a4b4de6301d94a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company\u2019 s business by\nincreasing the Compan y\u2019s costs, limiting the Company\u2019 s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, impacting customer demand for the\nCompany\u2019 s products and services, and requiring  changes to the Company\u2019 s supply chain and its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also\ncreate uncer tainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company\u2019 s products and\nservices are introduced into specialized applicat ions, including health and financial services. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed\nto ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company\u2019 s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such\nlaws and regulations or the Company\u2019 s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely\naffect the Company\u2019 s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect\nthe Company\u2019 s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from\nsuch measu res. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products.

Gross margins on the Com pany\u2019 s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers\ncould be materially adversely af fected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u2019 s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and\nearnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company\u2019 s products. In some circumstances, for\ncompetitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar \u2019s strengthening, which would adversely affect\nthe U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency\u2013denominated sales.\nConversely , a strengthening of foreign currencies  relative to the U.S. dollar , while generally beneficial to the Company\u2019 s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and\nearnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit.\nAdditionally , strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company\u2019 s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely\naffecting gross margins.\nThe Compan y uses derivative instruments, such  as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency\nexchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more  than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable\nmovements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\nThe Company\u2019 s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity , credit deteriorat ion, financial results, market and economic conditions, political\nrisk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company\u2019 s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and\nnon-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially . Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents,\nand marketa ble and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on\nthe Company\u2019 s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Compa ny is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply\nagreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\nThe Company distributes its products and certai n of its services through third-party cellular netw ork carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company\nalso sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the\nCompany\u2019 s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant\nportion of the Company\u2019 s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company\u2019 s exposure to credit and\ncollectibility risk on its trade receivables is highe r in certain international markets and its ability  to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has\nunsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or\nassemble final products for the Company .

Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases\nits stock in a given perio d to exceed the stock\u2019 s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future\ngrowth and profitability . The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow ,\nand that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company\u2019 s Board of Directors, and\nthe Company\u2019 s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to\nfuture growth, profitability , dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company\u2019 s stock may decline significantly , which could\nhave a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.\nItem 1B.

Legal Proceedings\nEpic Games\nEpic Games, Inc. (\u201cEpic \u201d) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the \u201cNorthern California District Court\u201d) against the\nCompany alleging violati ons of federal and state antitrust laws and California\u2019 s unfair competition law based upon the Company\u2019 s operation of its App Store. The\nCompany filed a counterclaim for breach of contract. On September 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to\nnine out of the ten counts included in Epic\u2019 s claim, and in favor of the Company with respect to the Company\u2019 s claims for breach of contract. The Northern\nCalifornia District Court found that certain provis ions of the Company\u2019 s App Store Review Guid elines violate California\u2019 s unfair competition law and issued an\ninjunction. Epic appealed the decision. The Company filed a cross-appeal and has been granted a stay pending the appeal.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Compan y is subject to other legal proceedi ngs and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The\nCompany settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2022 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company\u2019 s financial\ncondition or operating results.

The evaluation of the Company\u2019 s uncertain tax positions involves\nsignificant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP  and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the\nallocation of international taxation rights between  countries. Although management believes the Company\u2019 s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given\nthat the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company\u2019 s reserves.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management\nThe Compan y regularly reviews its foreign exch ange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with\nits underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the effective horizons of the Company\u2019 s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature\nof the expos ures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign\nexchange or interest rates. Further , the recognit ion of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses\nrelated to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely af fect the Company\u2019 s financial condition and operating results.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Compa ny\u2019s exposu re to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company\u2019 s investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While the Company is\nexposed to global intere st rate fluctuations, it is most affected by fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on\nthe Company\u2019 s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest\npaid on the Company\u2019 s debt.\nThe Company\u2019 s investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the Company\u2019 s liquidity requirements. The Company\nuses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically\ninvests in highly rated securities, with the primar y objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company\u2019 s investment policy generally requires\nsecurities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer . To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk\nassociated with the Company\u2019 s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analys is to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have\non the value of the investment portfolio assuming  a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 24, 2022 and\nSeptember 25, 2021, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.0 billion and $4.1 billion incremental\ndecline in the fair market value of the portfolio, respectively . Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity .\nAs of September 24, 2022, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes and as of September 25, 2021, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate\nnotes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $110.1 billion and $118.7 billion , respectively . The Company has entered, and in the future may\nenter , into interest rate swaps to manage interes t rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate\npayments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the\ncorresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the\nCompany\u2019 s debt as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 to increase by $201 million and $186 million on an annualized basis, respectively .\nForeign Currency Risk\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar . Accordingly , changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of\nthe U.S. dollar , will negatively affect the Company\u2019 s net sales and gross margins as expressed  in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to\nadjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institu tions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with\ncertain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition,\nthe Compan y has entered, and in the future may enter , into foreign currency contracts to partia lly offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its\nforeign curre ncy\u2013denominated debt issuances.

Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum\none-day loss in fair value  of $1.0 billion as of September 24, 2022, compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $550 million as of September 25, 2021.\nBecause the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by\nincreases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.\nActual future gains and losses associated with the Company\u2019 s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity\nanalyses performed as of September 24, 2022 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates,\nforeign currency exchange rates and the Company\u2019 s actual exposures and positions.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 27", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1735, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "df11d74e-292d-47ef-860e-348188dc4047": {"__data__": {"id_": "df11d74e-292d-47ef-860e-348188dc4047", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\vibud\\Desktop\\Github\\TensorFlow-for-DeepLearning\\K-llamaIndex\\v0.10\\data\\apple\\apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 840980, "creation_date": "2024-03-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "289d4d1d-0d1e-4ade-bce9-ebe533a6bcf1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\vibud\\Desktop\\Github\\TensorFlow-for-DeepLearning\\K-llamaIndex\\v0.10\\data\\apple\\apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 840980, "creation_date": "2024-03-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-28"}, "hash": "3e3f87779b562235f5365526c8db99449c2024b6f1c1d2c37f98011ca083d78d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6cb05eaf-8eeb-4d15-85ef-6a7dc70d4f7e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\vibud\\Desktop\\Github\\TensorFlow-for-DeepLearning\\K-llamaIndex\\v0.10\\data\\apple\\apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 840980, "creation_date": "2024-03-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-28"}, "hash": "711d8c7858ac5fbcea70350de2b409fe02bd03d266be860ccfe8cff20c03226e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9a948f58-6c43-487d-b320-e8a6c954b729", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "787a49280d66a491e08a88199ff30d19227e9e2d85be9d365c8f3e7facf4ccab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Item 8.

Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Preparation\nThe consolid ated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively \u201cApple\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d). Intercompany\naccounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles require s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ\nmaterially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to\nconform to the current period\u2019 s presentation.\nThe Compan y\u2019s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September . An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter\nevery five or six years to realign the Company\u2019 s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which will occur in the first quarter of the Company\u2019 s fiscal year ending\nSeptember 30, 2023. The Company\u2019 s fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years,\nquarters, months and periods refer to the Company\u2019 s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nRevenue Recognition\nNet sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it\nexpects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present\nright to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or servic es are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company\u2019 s\nProducts net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company\u2019 s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered.\nPayment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as\napplicable.\nThe Compan y records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the\nCompany\u2019 s expectations and historical experience.\nFor arrangem ents with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all\ndistinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\u201cSSPs\u201d). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine\nSSPs. When  observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company\u2019 s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance\nobligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company\u2019 s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers\nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices\ncharged by the Compan y for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings,  product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to\nprovide the performance obligation.\nThe Company has identified up to three perform ance obligations regularly included in arrangem ents involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other\nproducts. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered\nat the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-re lated bundled services, which include iCloud , Siri and Maps.\nThe third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled\nwith each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the\nCompany lacks observable prices for the undeliv ered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company\u2019 s estimated SSPs. Revenue\nallocated to the delivered hardware and bundled  software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer , which generally occurs when the product\nis shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line\nbasis over the estimate d period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, including estimated\nwarranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are\nrecognized as cost of sales as incurred.\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5191, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e77d2f48-2ecb-48a1-9d43-f58160e6bd72": {"__data__": {"id_": "e77d2f48-2ecb-48a1-9d43-f58160e6bd72", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\vibud\\Desktop\\Github\\TensorFlow-for-DeepLearning\\K-llamaIndex\\v0.10\\data\\apple\\apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 840980, "creation_date": "2024-03-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "797f398d-c135-45e2-9166-32393168ad95", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\vibud\\Desktop\\Github\\TensorFlow-for-DeepLearning\\K-llamaIndex\\v0.10\\data\\apple\\apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 840980, "creation_date": "2024-03-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-28"}, "hash": "63796be9ff4b86cf8b40e7edc0a3b1351b13b13e2b41811be86a10e865f9a70c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9fa0f242-c4af-43fb-8628-158d86c0b2fd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\vibud\\Desktop\\Github\\TensorFlow-for-DeepLearning\\K-llamaIndex\\v0.10\\data\\apple\\apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 840980, "creation_date": "2024-03-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-28"}, "hash": "11c9c9b8f414f9ad962739fcf037592b84f353a6fcfa918fc27ca250d2ac2416", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "26dadaec-7dac-4074-a89c-15bf28f68d7e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f904fc93dd12da631320f7675881cffb5e91631ee8df7dcb9f2aba4164b5d530", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs.

partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However , the Company may\nchoose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting conside rations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular\nexposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or\ninterest rates.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Compan y may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other\ninstruments, and may designate these instrume nts as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure\nassociated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.\nTo protect the Company \u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company\nmay enter into forward contracts, cross-currenc y swaps or other instruments.

As of Septembe r 24, 2022, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term\ndebt\u2013related foreign currency transactions is 20 years.\nThe Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accountin g hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in\nforeign curre ncy exchan ge rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange  gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain\nassets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company\u2019 s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other\ninstruments.

The State Aid Decision ordered\nIreland to calculate and recover additional taxes  from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of\nJanuary 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be \u20ac13.1 billion, plus interest of \u20ac1.2\nbillion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the \u201cGeneral Court\u201d). On\nJuly 15, 2020, the Gene ral Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court\u2019 s decision to\nthe European Court of Justice.

A company\u2019 s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation\nof financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made\nonly in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019 s assets that could have a material ef fect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent  limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate beca use of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nOctober 27, 2022\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 52", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4180, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d6cd143f-dd19-472d-969a-8998ffbe679a": {"__data__": {"id_": "d6cd143f-dd19-472d-969a-8998ffbe679a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "56", "file_name": "apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\vibud\\Desktop\\Github\\TensorFlow-for-DeepLearning\\K-llamaIndex\\v0.10\\data\\apple\\apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 840980, "creation_date": "2024-03-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5793cf91-3267-4c63-8ac2-02e6ab4f0d53", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "56", "file_name": "apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\vibud\\Desktop\\Github\\TensorFlow-for-DeepLearning\\K-llamaIndex\\v0.10\\data\\apple\\apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 840980, "creation_date": "2024-03-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-28"}, "hash": "4b2984c1e0624f4f633cc076a50b42a879d284e56073af73ae3bc54510bba736", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2fd99fe0-8984-472c-b6c6-e753e8abdc30", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\vibud\\Desktop\\Github\\TensorFlow-for-DeepLearning\\K-llamaIndex\\v0.10\\data\\apple\\apple-10k-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 840980, "creation_date": "2024-03-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-28"}, "hash": "c5f39a049d9aea3c47bb9a893d392eb5194fd9260ad9aa9f02d73d8db8133a3c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "82e6f3e5-f4fa-490a-b7de-2f0b4b3e96ad", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a1db0a8ab35d8232a6c315e716c7f27096a117998a4677ab54d7f1b4b6c82dd0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A.    Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company\u2019 s management, the Company\u2019 s principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer have concluded that the Compa ny\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act\nwere effective as of September 24, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or\nsubmits under the Exch ange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within  the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and\n(ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company\u2019 s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow\ntimely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nInherent Limitations over Internal Controls\nThe Company\u2019 s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). The Company\u2019 s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: \n(i) pertain to the maintenan ce of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company\u2019 s\nassets;\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with\nGAAP , and that the Company\u2019 s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company\u2019 s management\nand directors; and\n(iii) provide reasonable assu rance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company\u2019 s assets\nthat could have a material ef fect on the financial statements.\nManagement, including the Company\u2019 s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company\u2019 s internal controls will prevent or\ndetect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\nobjectives of the control system are met. Furthe r, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of\ncontrols must be consid ered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide\nabsolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future\nperiods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement\u2019 s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company\u2019 s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)\nunder the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019 s internal control over financial reporting based on the\ncriteria set forth in Internal Control \u2013 Integrate d Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013\nframework). Based on the Company\u2019 s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of\nSeptember 24, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance\nwith GAAP .

The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system,\nnumerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features\n(including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability , design innovation, a strong third-party software and\naccessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability , service and support, and corporate reputation.\nThe Company is focused  on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, persona l computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services.\nThe Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well\nas established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company\u2019 s competitors have broader product lines,\nlower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and\nlowered product margins . Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The\nCompany\u2019 s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and\napplications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\u2019 s product features and applications within their products, or\ncollaborate to of fer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently of fer.\nSupply of Components\nAlthough most components essential to the Com pany\u2019 s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from\nsingle or limited sources . The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers,\ntablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company , including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times\nsubject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitor s, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize\ncustom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the\nsuppliers\u2019  yields have matured or their manufact uring capacities have increased. The continued  availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all,\nmay be affected if suppliers decide to concent rate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019 s\nrequirements.\nThe Company has enter ed into agreements for the supply of many components; however , there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or\nrenew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\nResearch and Development\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technolog ical advances, the Company\u2019 s ability to compete successfully\ndepends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company\ncontinues to develop new technologies to enhan ce existing products and services, and to expan d the range of its offerings through research and development\n(\u201cR&D\u201d), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology .\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certa in aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and\nservices. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although\nthe Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in\npart on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\nThe Compa ny regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and\nmarketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and\nregistered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company\u2019 s products and\nservices. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property , many of the Company\u2019 s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third\nparties.

Additionally , new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales , cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product\nintroductions can also impact the Company\u2019 s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product\nlaunch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer produ ct approaches.

When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company\u2019 s business, reputation, results of\noperations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely af fected.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\u2019 s results of opera tions and financial condition, past financial performance should\nnot be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nThis discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019 s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\nThe Compa ny\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can\nmaterially adversely af fect the Company\u2019 s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Compa ny has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\u2019 s total net sales. In addition, the Company\u2019 s\nglobal suppl y chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company\u2019 s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the\nU.S. As a result, the Company\u2019 s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemploymen t, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency\nfluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adverse ly affect demand for the Company\u2019 s products and services. In\naddition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy , financial market volatility ,\ndeclines in income or asset values, and other economic factors.\nIn addition to an adverse  impact on demand for the Company\u2019 s products and services, uncertain ty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions\ncan have a significant impact on the Company\u2019 s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel\npartners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency .\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company\u2019 s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties\nand other financial institu tions; limitations on the Company\u2019 s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company\u2019 s financial\ninstruments.

Substantially all of the Company\u2019 s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners\nlocated primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on\nimports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019 s operations and supply chain and limit the Company\u2019 s ability to\noffer and distribute its products and services to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions\nwhere the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can require the Company\nto take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing\nthe Company\u2019 s operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the\nCompany\u2019 s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse\nimpacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions\nbeing impos ed on the Company\u2019 s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly\nmore severe  and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019 s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international\ndisputes could also have a negative ef fect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely af fect the Company\u2019 s business.\nMany of the Company\u2019 s operations and facilities , as well as critical business operations of the Company\u2019 s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations\nthat are prone to earth quakes and other natur al disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power\nshortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks,\nlabor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company\u2019 s control. Global climate\nchange is resulting in certain types of natural disasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes  and wildfires, occurring more frequently or with more intense\neffects. Such  events can make it difficult or impo ssible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in\nthe Compan y\u2019s supply and manufacturing chain , and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company\u2019 s service offerings, and negatively impact consumer\nspending and demand in affected areas. Following an interruption to its business, the Compan y can require substantial recovery time, experience significant\nexpenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many\ncritical components, a business interruption af fecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company .\nThe Compan y\u2019s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company\u2019 s suppliers are\nrequired to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to\nthe Compan y\u2019s business, and harm to the Com pany\u2019 s reputation.

In contrast, many of the Company\u2019 s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures,\nand by imitating the Company\u2019 s products and infringing on its intellectual property . Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every\ncountry in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if\ncompetitors infringe on the Company\u2019 s intellectual property , the Company\u2019 s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely af fected.\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in\nthese markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital\ncontent supplier relationships. In addition, some  of the Company\u2019 s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of\nactive device s. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have\nthe resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have\nfrom time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\nAdditionally , the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\u2019 s product features and applications within their products or\ncollaborate to offer solutions that are more comp etitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate\nthe Company\u2019 s approach to providing components seamlessly within their of ferings or work collaboratively to of fer integrated solutions.\nThe Compa ny\u2019s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established\nservice offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes\nwith illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.\nThe Company\u2019 s business, results of operations  and financial condition depend substantially on the Company\u2019 s ability to continually improve its products and\nservices to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Com pany will be able to continue to provide products and services\nthat compete ef fectively .\nBusiness Risks\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products\nand services.\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature  of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new\nproducts, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and\nservices, and successfully manage the transitio n to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions\ndepends on a number of factors, including timel y and successful development, market acceptance, the Company\u2019 s ability to manage the risks associated with\nnew technol ogies and production ramp-up issue s, the availability of application software for the Company\u2019 s products, the effective management of purchase\ncommitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet\nanticipated demand, and the risk that new produ cts and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will\nsuccessfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services.\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical servic es provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are\nlocated outside of the U.S.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019 s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan,\nSouth Korea , Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is curre ntly performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often\nin single locations.

Any failure of these partners to perform can have a\nnegative impact on the Company\u2019 s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition , manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final\ndestinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes,\narmed conflict, economic, business, labor , environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.\nThe Company has inves ted in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to\ncertain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if\nthese outsou rcing partne rs or suppliers experien ce severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or\nterminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company\u2019 s ability to obtain components in suf ficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many\ncomponents, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing\nfluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019 s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor\nindustry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply , which adversely affected the Company\u2019 s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of\ncomponents and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into\nagreements for the supp ly of many components,  there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or\nat all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to busin ess failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular\nindustry , further limiting the Company\u2019 s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or\nregional economic conditions on the Company\u2019 s suppliers, described in \u201cThe Compan y\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional\neconomic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019 s business, results of operations and financial condition, \u201d\nabove, can also affect the Company\u2019 s ability to obtain components . Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price\nincreases that can materially adversely af fect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019 s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source . When a component or product uses new technologies, initial\ncapacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019  yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these\ncomponents at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including  if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common\ncomponents instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019 s requirements. When the Company\u2019 s supply of components for a new or existing product\nhas been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company , the Company\u2019 s business,\nresults of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019 s\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. The Company\u2019 s business and finan cial performance could also be materially adversely affected\ndepending on the time required to obtain suf ficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain suf ficient quantities from an alternative source.\nThe Company\u2019 s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect\nthe Company\u2019 s business and result in harm to the Company\u2019 s reputation.\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects.

The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for order s of excess products and components. The Company reviews\nlong-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\u2019  facilities and inventory prepayme nts, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate\nthe assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occur red, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the\ncarrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory , capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and\npurchase commitments are currently recoverab le, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges\ngiven the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.\nThe Compa ny orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase\nobligations cover the Company\u2019 s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typica lly for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company\u2019 s markets\nare volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or\ninsuf ficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property , which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or\nat all.\nThe Company\u2019 s products and services are desig ned to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In\naddition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent\ncoverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company\u2019 s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property\nrights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.\nBased on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially\nreasonable terms. Howe ver, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the\nright to use third-party intellectual property , or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain\nproducts or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019 s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019 s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\nThe Compa ny believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and\nservices.

For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue\nthey genera te on the App Store. The Compan y retains a commission from sales of applicat ions and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an\napplication. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market conditions and legal\nand regulato ry requirem ents. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the\nApp Store, such as the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) Digital Markets Act, which the Company is requir ed to comply with by March 2024. The Company is also subject\nto litigation and investiga tions relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company\u2019 s business practices, and may in the future result in\nfurther chan ges. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outsid e the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms.\nFuture chan ges could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App\nStore, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. This\ncould reduce the volume  of sales, and the comm ission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease.

Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company\u2019 s\naccess to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices\nwith acceptable usage rules.\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and\nsubscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company\u2019 s customers.\nSome third-party digital content providers requir e the Company to provide digital rights manage ment and other security solutions.

System upgrades, redundancy and other continuity\nmeasures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company\u2019 s or its vendors\u2019  business contin uity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all\neventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company\u2019 s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company\u2019 s online\nservices, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company\u2019 s products. These events could materially adversely\naffect the Company\u2019 s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nLosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant\nreputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.\nThe Compa ny\u2019s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with respect to the Company\u2019 s customers and\nemployees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security , including through the use of encryption and other security measures\nintended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security , and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential\ninformation occur and could materially adversely af fect the Company\u2019 s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Compan y\u2019s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are\nalso exposed to ransom ware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operatio ns. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential\ninformation that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company\u2019 s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or\nunauthorized access to, or releases of, confid ential information occur . Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the\nCompany\u2019 s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to\ncompromise the confidentiality , integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the\nCompany\u2019 s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Comp any\u2019s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships,\nand expose the Company to litigation or govern ment investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company .

New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company\u2019 s business by\nincreasing the Company\u2019 s costs, limiting the Company\u2019 s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the\nCompany\u2019 s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company\u2019 s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company\u2019 s supply chain\nand its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied.\nThese risks and costs may increase as the Company\u2019 s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial\nservices. The Company has implemented polici es and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no\nassurance the Company\u2019 s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company\u2019 s policies and procedures. If the\nCompany is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019 s business, reputation, results of operations and\nfinancial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company\u2019 s business may be announced with little or no advance\nnotice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing\nregulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy\nregulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a\nresult, the Company\u2019 s products could be bann ed, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019 s business,\nreputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose the Company to potential\nliabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse ef fects on the Company\u2019 s business.\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance\nconsiderations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity , equity and inclusion. In\naddition, the Company makes statements abou t its goals and initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press\nstatements and other communications.

For example, the gross margins on the\nCompany\u2019 s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company\u2019 s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure\ndue to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressure s and product pricing actions that the Company may take in\nresponse to such pressu res; increased competition; the Company\u2019 s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed\nproduct life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering\ncontent for the Company\u2019 s services; the Compan y\u2019s ability to manage product quality and warran ty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or\nin the geographic, curre ncy or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings;\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or\nservices with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019 s results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday\ndemand. Additionally , new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further , the Company\ngenerates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The\nCompany could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company\u2019 s products or services, issues with new\nproduct or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company\u2019 s logistics, components supply ,\nor manufacturing partners.\nThe Company\u2019 s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.\nThe Compan y\u2019s primary exposure to movements  in foreign exchange rates relates to non\u2013U.S. dollar\u2013denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses\nworldwide. Gross margins on the Company\u2019 s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the\npast been adversely af fected and could in the future be materially adversely af fected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u2019 s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and\nearnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company\u2019 s products. In some circumstances, for\ncompetitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar \u2019s strengthening, which would adversely affect\nthe U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency\u2013denominated sales.\nConversely , a strengthening of foreign currencies  relative to the U.S. dollar , while generally beneficial to the Company\u2019 s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and\nearnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreig n currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit.\nAdditionally , strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company\u2019 s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely\naffecting gross margins.\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign\nexchange rates.

The Company\nalso sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the\nCompany\u2019 s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant\nportion of the Company\u2019 s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company\u2019 s exposure to credit and\ncollectibility risk on its trade receivables is highe r in certain international markets and its ability  to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has\nunsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or\nassemble final products for the Company . In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of\ninventory components. As of September 30, 2023, the Company\u2019 s vendor non-trade receivables  and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were\nconcentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia.

Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be\nsubject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing\ninternational tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Compa ny\u2019s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of\nearnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes\nin tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to dif fering interpretations.\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and\ngovernmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its\nprovision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company\u2019 s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate\ndetermination of the Company\u2019 s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previousl y accrued, the Company\u2019 s business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition could be materially adversely af fected.\nGeneral Risks\nThe price of the Company\u2019 s stock is subject to volatility .\nThe Company\u2019 s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future.

On September 10,\n2021, the District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic\u2019 s claim. The District Court found that certain\nprovisions of the Comp any\u2019s App Store Review Guidelines violate California\u2019 s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from\nprohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing.

On April 24, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the \u201cCircuit\nCourt\u201d) affirmed the District Court\u2019 s ruling.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe Compa ny is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies to manage these risks;\nhowever , they may still impact the Company\u2019 s consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company is primar ily exposed to fluctuatio ns in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company\u2019 s investment portfolio and term debt. Increases in\ninterest rates  will negatively affect the fair value of the Company\u2019 s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company\u2019 s term debt. To protect\nagainst interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset interest rate\u2013sens itive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment\nand term debt portfolios.\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company\u2019 s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any associated derivatives, that\nwould result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 (dollars in millions):\nInterest Rate\nSensitive InstrumentHypothetical Interest\nRate Increase Potential Impact 2023 2022\nInvestment portfolio 100 basis points, all tenors Decline in fair value $ 3,089 $ 4,022 \nTerm debt 100 basis points, all tenors Increase in annual interest expense $ 194 $ 201 \nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nThe Compan y\u2019s exposur e to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar . Changes in\nexchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar , will negatively affect the Company\u2019 s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S.\ndollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of the Company\u2019 s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate\nrisk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However , the Company may\nchoose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (\u201cVAR\u201d) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates.\nThe VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\u2019 s foreign\ncurrency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum\none-day loss in fair value  of $669 million and $1.0 billion as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively . Changes in the Company\u2019 s underlying\nforeign curre ncy exposures, which were exclu ded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the Company\u2019 s foreign currency\nderivatives.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 26", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3049, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6942814b-207d-420e-abd8-2c6e79eee92d": {"__data__": {"id_": "6942814b-207d-420e-abd8-2c6e79eee92d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "apple-10k-2023.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\vibud\\Desktop\\Github\\TensorFlow-for-DeepLearning\\K-llamaIndex\\v0.10\\data\\apple\\apple-10k-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 807316, "creation_date": "2024-03-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9c535b48-7dac-45d0-b78f-b466c249c991", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "apple-10k-2023.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\vibud\\Desktop\\Github\\TensorFlow-for-DeepLearning\\K-llamaIndex\\v0.10\\data\\apple\\apple-10k-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 807316, "creation_date": "2024-03-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-28"}, "hash": "9034d74023c41d856b726d686f28f80e87a4f0686a872f834cef0985c2d9f9b9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "36f053c5-83a8-4a4f-986c-b13921f5a7d2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "apple-10k-2023.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\vibud\\Desktop\\Github\\TensorFlow-for-DeepLearning\\K-llamaIndex\\v0.10\\data\\apple\\apple-10k-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 807316, "creation_date": "2024-03-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-28"}, "hash": "e74343a25a4a38353ceafc8a42654f22e590e0ac6f6b882c38f5c3d8ee0849da", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9621f57b-ea42-4117-8439-5ec3f3ccb5fd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8027a66d5eab1fd20467d49f01f2ca4df552b0dd8bb9de9fefaa447a0727eac5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Item 8.

For most of the Company\u2019 s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company\u2019 s\nServices net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following\ntransfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\nThe Compan y records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the\nCompany\u2019 s expectations and historical experience.\nFor arrangem ents with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all\ndistinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\u201cSSPs\u201d). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine\nSSPs. When  observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company\u2019 s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance\nobligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company\u2019 s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers\nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices\ncharged by the Compan y for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings,  product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to\nprovide the performance obligation.\nThe Company has identified up to three perform ance obligations regularly included in arrangem ents involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other\nproducts. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered\nat the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-re lated bundled services, which include iCloud , Siri and Maps.\nThe third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled\nwith each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the\nCompany lacks observable prices for the undeliv ered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company\u2019 s estimated SSPs. Revenue\nallocated to the delivered hardware and bundled  software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer , which generally occurs when the product\nis shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line\nbasis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the\nCompany does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of\nthe undelivered services. Accordingly , the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.\nFor the sale of third-part y products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer , the Company recognizes revenue\nbased on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when  determining whether it obtains control of third-party products,\nincluding evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the\nproduct. For third-party applications sold throug h the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer .\nTherefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application\u2013related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.\u00ae \u00ae\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 34", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4547, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a2654071-cabb-4d0f-be35-723134be7c63": {"__data__": {"id_": "a2654071-cabb-4d0f-be35-723134be7c63", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "apple-10k-2023.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\vibud\\Desktop\\Github\\TensorFlow-for-DeepLearning\\K-llamaIndex\\v0.10\\data\\apple\\apple-10k-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 807316, "creation_date": "2024-03-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c5d5e703-b434-406e-b528-c7752305a8c5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "apple-10k-2023.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\vibud\\Desktop\\Github\\TensorFlow-for-DeepLearning\\K-llamaIndex\\v0.10\\data\\apple\\apple-10k-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 807316, "creation_date": "2024-03-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-28"}, "hash": "8be9a8248d45e051f363c8d28ad68da56b9de8b99a71a194278bfbd571384c93", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a7a24a6f-002a-4d43-8314-5013d6667728", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "apple-10k-2023.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\vibud\\Desktop\\Github\\TensorFlow-for-DeepLearning\\K-llamaIndex\\v0.10\\data\\apple\\apple-10k-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 807316, "creation_date": "2024-03-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-28"}, "hash": "4351aa131709a62865b930745ac13ff1d90e7530fb00e3e1db32cc76dec8359b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "11cd69f7-aa11-4e02-805d-637150a6f3c2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9c953a32c1ba7710b2d56504a8f903edaf4caba8362f25af4488c82d052ef0a6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in millions):\n2023 2022 2021\niPhone $ 200,583 $ 205,489 $ 191,973 \nMac 29,357 40,177 35,190 \niPad 28,300 29,292 31,862 \nWearables, Home and Accessories 39,845 41,241 38,367 \nServices 85,200 78,129 68,425 \nTotal net sales $ 383,285 $ 394,328 $ 365,817 \n(1)Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective\nproduct.\n(2)Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.\nTotal net sales include $8.2 billion of revenue recognized in 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 24, 2022, $7.5 billion of revenue\nrecognized in 2022 that was included in deferr ed revenue as of September 25, 2021, and $6.7 billion of revenue recognized in 2021 that was included in\ndeferred revenue as of September 26, 2020.\nThe Compa ny\u2019s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 13, \u201cSegment\nInformation and Geographic Data\u201d for 2023, 2022 and 2021, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net\nsales.\nAs of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.1 billion and $12.4 billion, respectively .

The Company classifies marketable debt\nsecurities as either current or non-current based solely on each instrument\u2019 s underlying contractual maturity date.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However , the Company may\nchoose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting conside rations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular\nexposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or\ninterest rates.\nThe Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments in the same section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as the items being\nhedged, which are generally classified as operating activities.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these\ninstruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory\npurchases, typically for up to 12 months.\nTo protect the Company\u2019 s foreign currency\u2013denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use\nforwards, cross-currency swaps or other instrum ents. The Company designates these instrumen ts as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 30,\n2023, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the varia bility in future cash flows for term debt\u2013related foreign currency\ntransactions is 19 years.\nThe Compan y may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedg es to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign\nexchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities\ndenominated in non-functional currencies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company \u2019s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates , the Company may use interest rate swaps, options or other\ninstruments.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.\u2019s financial statements\nbased on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit s in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.

Our audits included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures  in the financial statements.

A company\u2019 s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation\nof financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made\nonly in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019 s assets that could have a material ef fect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent  limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate beca use of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nNovember 2, 2023\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 51", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4180, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc224348-45b5-4af4-83a1-4caab605fdc7": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc224348-45b5-4af4-83a1-4caab605fdc7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "apple-10k-2023.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\vibud\\Desktop\\Github\\TensorFlow-for-DeepLearning\\K-llamaIndex\\v0.10\\data\\apple\\apple-10k-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 807316, "creation_date": "2024-03-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7da11f35-1c8f-4a21-8d27-bb1e71328bb4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "apple-10k-2023.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\vibud\\Desktop\\Github\\TensorFlow-for-DeepLearning\\K-llamaIndex\\v0.10\\data\\apple\\apple-10k-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 807316, "creation_date": "2024-03-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-28"}, "hash": "978a197229924d6753620e451f5c6385ea4e9186ebfaa4d4f1793fc5e42749db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ffab8f03-c6a4-4edd-8e26-bb201caaf895", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "apple-10k-2023.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\vibud\\Desktop\\Github\\TensorFlow-for-DeepLearning\\K-llamaIndex\\v0.10\\data\\apple\\apple-10k-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 807316, "creation_date": "2024-03-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-28"}, "hash": "c525f412a7f1067f922d255b1eb51508ad5727758287a56e0a17b083ba24cdc4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fab05483-ba8a-4d51-90d6-faf9bf9f5746", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "539818a27b8991ec6e54e55ce6c6bd5acc0f6ce22ea160ed6d71f9ebd0269fcc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A.    Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company\u2019 s management, the Company\u2019 s principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer have concluded that the Compa ny\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act\nwere effective as of September 30, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or\nsubmits under the Exch ange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within  the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and\n(ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company\u2019 s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow\ntimely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nInherent Limitations over Internal Controls\nThe Company\u2019 s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external  purposes in accordance with GAAP . The Com pany\u2019 s internal control over financial reporting includes those\npolicies and procedures that: \n(i) pertain to the maintenan ce of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company\u2019 s\nassets;\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with\nGAAP , and that the Company\u2019 s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company\u2019 s management\nand directors; and\n(iii) provide reasonable assu rance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company\u2019 s assets\nthat could have a material ef fect on the financial statements.\nManagement, including the Company\u2019 s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company\u2019 s internal controls will prevent or\ndetect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\nobjectives of the control system are met. Furthe r, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of\ncontrols must be consid ered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide\nabsolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future\nperiods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement\u2019 s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company\u2019 s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)\nunder the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019 s internal control over financial reporting based on the\ncriteria set forth in Internal Control \u2013 Integrate d Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013\nframework). Based on the Company\u2019 s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of\nSeptember 30, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance\nwith GAAP .
