# Indexes

## Concept
An `Index` is a data structure that allows us to quickly retrieve relevant context for a user query.
For LlamaIndex, it's the core foundation for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) use-cases.


At a high-level, `Indices` are built from [Documents](/core_modules/data_modules/documents_and_nodes/root.md).
They are used to build [Query Engines](/core_modules/query_modules/query_engine/root.md) and [Chat Engines](/core_modules/query_modules/chat_engines/root.md)
which enables question & answer and chat over your data.  

Under the hood, `Indices` store data in `Node` objects (which represent chunks of the original documents), and expose a [Retriever](/core_modules/query_modules/retriever/root.md) interface that supports additional configuration and automation.
