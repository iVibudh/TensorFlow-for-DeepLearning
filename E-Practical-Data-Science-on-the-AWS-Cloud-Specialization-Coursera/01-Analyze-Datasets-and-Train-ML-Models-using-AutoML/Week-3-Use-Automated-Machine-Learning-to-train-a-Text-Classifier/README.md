### Week 3:
- Introduction
- Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)
    - The concept of using ML combined with automation to automate the process of building a model.
- AutoML Workflow
    - typical Machine Learning workflow and some of the common tasks performed. 
- Amazon Sagemaker **Autopilot**
    - automate the data exploration and analysis, selecting the right algorithm and performing feature engineering, then automating and training your tuning experiments until you have that model that is performing well or a model that can be used as a staring point.  
    - allows to experiment at scale without manual constraints and computing resources. 
- Running experiments with Amazon Sagemaker Autopilot
    - Review and understand the output resources and artifacts that are automatically produced:
- Amazon SageMaker Autopilot: evaluating output
- VideoAmazon SageMaker Autopilot demo
- Model hosting
    - using a Sagemaker managed endpoint
