### 1. Analyze Datasets and Train ML Models using AutoML
- Data Science in the cloud (the easy way)
- Exploratory Data analysis and detect statistical data bias
- Then train a ML model using AutoML nad build a multi-class text classification model. 

### 2. Build, Train, and Deploy ML Pipelines using BERT

- Build ML pipeline, perform feature engineering, and share your features with the rest of the organization using a scalable feature store. 
- You will then train, tune, and deploy the model. 
- You will orchestrate the model workflow using ML pipelines, and MLOps strategies. 


### 3. Optimize ML Models and Deploy Human-in-the-Loop Pipelines
- Optimize Machine Learning Pipelines and learn best practices on tuning hyper parameters, and performing distributed model training. 
- You will learn about advanced model deployment as well as monitoring options
- how to perform large scale data labelling, and build human-in-the-Loop Pipelines to improve your model accuracy and performance by combining machine intelligence with human intelligence.
