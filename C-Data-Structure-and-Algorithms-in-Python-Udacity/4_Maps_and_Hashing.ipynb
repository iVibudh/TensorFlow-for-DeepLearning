    "As it turns out there is a flaw in our elegant system. There are times when a hash function will spit out the same hash value for 2 different inputs. This situation is termed as Collision. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fixes:\n",
    "1. Change the value in your hash function, or to change the hash function completely, so you have more thna enough slots to store all of your potential values. \n",
    "    - You can maintain constant time look up but by using a bigger number in your hash function, you're going to require a lot more space to store your values. \n",
    "    - If you do it reactively and change the value range in your hash function, you will have to move your data to a new larger array is going to increase the complexity in terms of time and size.         \n",
    "2. Change the structure of your array. Instead of storing one hash value in eash slot, you can store some type of lists that contains all values hashed at that spot. These lists are called **buckets** (a collection of values)\n",
    "    - You still need to itteratte through all the elements in the bucket. Though these buckets are smaller. \n",
    "    - Best Case O(1)\n",
    "    - Worst Case O(n) - case when all elements are in the same bucket. So you are itterating though all the elements to find the one you are looking for. \n",
    "    - Get more creative by having a second level hash function which splits the elements in each buckets. \n",

For example, if we're trying to store 10 values in a hash table with 1000 buckets, the load factor would be 0.01, and the majority of buckets in the table will be empty. We end up wasting memory by having so many empty buckets, so we may want to rehash, or come up with a new hash function with less buckets. We can use our load factor as an indicator for when to rehashâ€”as the load factor approaches 0, the more empty, or sparse, our hash table is.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the flip side, the closer our load factor is to 1 (meaning the number of values equals the number of buckets), the better it would be for us to rehash and add more buckets. Any table with a load value greater than 1 is guaranteed to have collisions."
