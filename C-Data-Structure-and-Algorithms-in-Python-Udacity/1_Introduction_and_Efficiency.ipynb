    "#### Solution \n",
    "We iterate over every manatee in the manatees list with the for loop. Since we're given that manatees has n elements, our code will take approximately O(n) time to run.\n",

    "Example 1: \n",
    "We iterate over every manatee in the manatees list with the for loop. Since we're given that manatees has n elements, our code will take approximately O(n) time to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2: \n",
    "We look at two specific properties of a specific manatee. We aren't iterating over anything - just doing constant-time lookups on lists and dictionaries. Thus the code will complete in constant, or O(1), time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3: \n",
    "There are two for loops, and nested for loops are a good sign that you need to multiply two runtimes. Here, for every manatee, we check every property. If we had 4 manatees, each with 5 properties, then we would need 5+5+5+5 steps. This logic simplifies to the number of manatees times the number of properties, or O(nm).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 4: \n",
    "Again we have nested for loops. This time we're iterating over the manatees list twice - every time we see a manatee, we compare it to every other manatee's age. We end up with O(nn), or O(n^2) (which is read as \"n squared\").\n",
