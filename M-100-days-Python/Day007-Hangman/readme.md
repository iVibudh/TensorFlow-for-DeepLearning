# Hangman Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game in Python. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player has to guess letters to uncover the hidden word. The player starts with a certain number of lives, and each incorrect guess results in losing a life. The game ends either when the player correctly guesses the word or runs out of lives.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

### Run the code

```python main.py ```
