# Higher Lower Game
Welcome to the Higher Lower Game! This simple Python console-based game challenges you to guess which of two randomly selected social media accounts has more followers. The game includes a scoring system and engaging ASCII art for an enjoyable experience.

## Getting Started
To play the game, follow these steps:

- Run the main.py file in your Python environment.
- Compare the follower counts of two randomly chosen social media accounts.
- Input your guess ('A' or 'B') for the account with more followers.
- See if your guess is correct and track your score.

## How It Works
- The game fetches data from a predefined list of social media accounts.
- Each round, two accounts are presented, and the player must guess which one has more followers.
- The game continues until an incorrect guess is made, and the final score is displayed.

## Note on Game Logic
- The game picks 'A' and 'B' from a predefined list of dictionary objects. These are just celebraties - the data for these celebrities is not reliable and the number of followers is just an estimate, might not be an actual representation.
