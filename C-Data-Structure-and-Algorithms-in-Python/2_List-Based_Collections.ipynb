    "\n",
    "For example, inserting into a list is easy (happens in constant time). However, inserting into an array is O(n), since you may need to shift elements to make space for the one you're inserting, or even copy everything to a new array if you run out of space. Thus, inserting into a Python list is actually O(n), while operations that search for an element at a particular spot are O(1). You can see the runtime of other list operations here. <br>\n",

However, there's a lot of code built into the infrastructure in this way that causes your code to actually run much more slowly than you'd think. Keep this in the back of your mind when using Python. You likely won't need to know the details of how Python works behind the scenes in a programming interview, but you'll seem very impressive if you do!\n",
